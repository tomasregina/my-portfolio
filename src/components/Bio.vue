    <p class="text-left pb-10 ">I grow up in small town called Modra, near slovak capital Bratislava. I studied geoinformatic, cartography and remote sense of Earth on Comenius Univeristy in Bratislava.
      Already during the study I primary oriented on programming, so as practical part of my bachelor and master thesis I've chose building a webapps for 3D terrain visualization with Cesium.js library and map app for displaying detailed information from slovak cadastral system.
      As student I started as intern in well known slovak bank and I mainly focused on macro development with VBA and simple SQL tasks. After I graduated from university, I started work in slovak tech company focused on geoinformatic.
      As frontend developer, I developed map applications mainly for government rail company, using Vue.js and "vanilla" javascript. I also got familiar with SQL (Oracle and SQL Server ) and with C# on backend.
      After rouglhy 3 years, I left and started working as freelancer for start-up - open platform for providing bicycle guiding, camps, training, vacations... . I developed frontend components with React.js and static pages with Tailwind.js with Figma designs as templates.
